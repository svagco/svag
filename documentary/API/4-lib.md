## Lib

The [`@svag/lib`](https://github.com/svagco/lib) has a number of methods to create dynamically generated SVGs.

- `makeElement`: create a new SVG element.
- `roundedCorner`: write a C directive of the path to make a rounded corner, e.g., to create rectangles with only some rounded corners.
- `minify`: remove whitespace between tags.

**[Elements](t)**: For easier access to elements, some of them were converted into methods, along with their documentation. The autocompletion hints can be accessed by hitting <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>space</kbd> combination when writing a call to any API function.

- `svg`: make a complete `svg` image.
- `react`: draw a rectangle.
