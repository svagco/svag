## Lib

The [`@svag/lib`](https://github.com/svagco/lib) has a number of methods to create dynamically generated SVGs.

1. `makeElement`: create a new SVG element.
1. `roundedCorner`: write a C directive of the path to make a rounded corner, e.g., to create rectangles with only some rounded corners.
1. `minify`: remove whitespace between tags.

**[Elements](t)**: For easier access to elements, some elements were converted into methods, along with their documentation.

1. `svg`: make a new complete `svg` image.
1. `react`: draw a rectangle.
